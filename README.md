# 30 Days of Problem Solving - Level 1

Welcome to my 30 Days of Problem Solving - Level 1 repository! This is a personal challenge I have undertaken to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## What is this repository about?

This repository is designed to help me develop problem-solving skills by solving easy LeetCode problems in Level 1. Every day, for 30 days, I will be provided with 1 coding problem to solve. In addition to the problem, I will find the sample input, expected output, and explanations.

## How to use this repository?

The repository is divided into 30 folders, one for each day of the challenge. Each folder contains a problem, named after the problem's number, along with sample input and expected output. I can create my solution files with the name of the problem number.

Once I have written the solution to a problem, I can submit it to the corresponding folder.

## Conclusion

Improving problem-solving skills requires patience and persistence. I hope this challenge helps me to achieve my goals and improve my skills. Happy coding!
